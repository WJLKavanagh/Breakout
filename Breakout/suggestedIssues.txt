FIXES:

* Load textures, do not unload them to leak some good, good memory.

* Make the brick manager unwieldy as hell, put bricks in a DLL?

* Make pausing more robust.

* Not resetting a value that should be reset on game start is a classic.



IMPROVEMENTS:

* Particle system on the bricks being destroyed.

* Implement box2D and improve the physics handling.

* Powerup that makes bricks explode, destroying neighbours.
